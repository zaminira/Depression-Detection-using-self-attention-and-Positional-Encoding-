Detecting depression using depressive tweets using multi head attention and positional encoding

The data used are labeled tweets. I used EDA to understand the data and next did data preprocessing steps for improved model performance. 
The tweets were tokanized and embedded using googlenews embedding. Then there were used in a multi head self attention algorithm for accurate detection. 
The model reaches 90% accuracy.
